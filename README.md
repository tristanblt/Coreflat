First off, create a new champion or load an existing one.

Click on the instruction you want to add on the right of the screen.
You can then move it using the arrows.

You can add a register by dragging and dropping the desired register number directly into the instruction's argument.

Type direct and indirect numbers using your keyboard and then drag and drop the 'n' into the instruction's argument.

Add a label by clicking on the yellow '+' left of the instruction.
To add a label as an argument, click on it (in the box just above the registers) and drag and drop the n into the instruction's argument.

Remove an instruction by clicking on the red X button next to the undesired instruction.

Once you're done, save your champion and he'll be ready to go!
